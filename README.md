Website for aural training, created with nodeJS, react native, and love.

To run this locally:

1. Open a terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/OU-HCI-18/website.git` and `cd website`
2. Install [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Go back to the terminal open to this project
4. Install [ToneJS](https://tonejs.github.io/) and other dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Run `npm start`
6. Hack away and view the changes you make live!
7. To deploy, run `npm run deploy`

## TODO

- [x] Add a todo list to github
- [x] create piano, staff, settings branches
- [x] debug the piano input - Jack
- [] create a staff input
- [x] write-up settings page description (possible values etc) - Michael
- [] create a settings page - Noah
- [x] write the tone generation algorithm (psudeo-code) - Scottie
- [x] implement the tone generation algorithm - Jack
- [x] extend tone generation algorithm to two octaves - Scottie
- [x] implement extended algorithm - Jack

Then, we can:

- [] get user feedback, round 2
- [] implement any necessary changes
- [] work on the final report and usability analysis

Planned Features (not implemented yet, low priority):

- [] hover note labels
- [] different instrument options in the settings
- [] setting for one-octave mode to contain either 4th or 5th octave

# Information from creating the website via the Create React App script

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
